## Project Statement

### Title
**Team Management System for Academic Projects**

### Problem Statement
In academic environments, students face significant challenges in managing team-based projects effectively. The lack of organized systems for tracking project progress, team member assignments, milestone completion, and deadline management often leads to project failures, missed deadlines, and inefficient team coordination.

### Objective
To develop a comprehensive Python-based console application that enables students to efficiently manage their academic team projects by providing tools for project creation, team member management, milestone tracking, and progress monitoring.

### Scope of Work
The project encompasses the development of a complete team management system with the following capabilities:

1. **Project Management Module**
   - Create and manage multiple academic projects
   - Track project status and deadlines
   - Maintain project information and details

2. **Team Management Module**
   - Register and manage team members
   - Assign students to specific projects
   - Track individual workload and assignments

3. **Milestone Tracking Module**
   - Create project milestones with due dates
   - Monitor milestone completion status
   - Track overall project progress

4. **Reporting and Visualization**
   - Display comprehensive project information
   - Generate project status reports
   - Provide team assignment overviews

### Technical Specifications
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Application Type**: Console-based application
- **Data Storage**: In-memory data structures (dictionaries and lists)
- **User Interface**: Menu-driven command-line interface
- **Architecture**: Procedural programming with modular function design

### Expected Outcomes
Upon completion, the system will provide:
- A fully functional team management application
- Demonstration of core Python programming concepts
- Practical solution to real-world academic challenges
- Comprehensive documentation and user guides
- Tested and validated software system

### Success Criteria
